Exercises:

1. List of multiples of n from 1 to 100, for n in [2, 3, 7, 9]

Output example: 
n = 2 => [2, 4, 6, 8, ...]
n = 3 => [3, 6, 9, 12, ...]
etc.

2. Terms of a Geometric Series

3. L = [85, 34, 6, -3, 0, 6, 7, -5, 9]

How to get:
a) [-3, 0, -5]
b) [34, 0, -5]
c) [85, 34, 6]
d) [9, -5, 7, 6, 0, -3, 6, 34, 85]
Two methods: using slicing and methods of lists
